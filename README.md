   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured design to maintain consistency and scalability. Below is an overview of the file organization:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/            # Application-specific logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Shared UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/          # Custom hooks
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/            # Utility libraries
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server/         # Server-side logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/         # Configuration files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # TypeScript type definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/       # Modular feature-specific logic
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ public/             # Static assets
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/              # Next.js page routes
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/             # Global styles
â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.js        # ESLint configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json        # Project dependencies
```

The `boundaries` ESLint plugin enforces module import boundaries:
- **Shared Modules**: Can be accessed by any other module.
- **Feature Modules**: Can only import shared modules or other modules within the same feature.
- **App Modules**: Can import shared and feature modules.
- **Restricted Imports**: Files in `src/tasks/` should not be directly imported.

## Coding Guidelines

To maintain consistency across the project, follow these guidelines:
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety.
- Follow **Next.js best practices**.
- Use **ESLint and Prettier** for code formatting.
- Organize code based on the projectâ€™s structure.
- Keep feature modules independent and encapsulated.
