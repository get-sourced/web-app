## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the `Fork` button on the repository page to create a copy in your account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   cd repository-name
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured design to maintain consistency and scalability. Below is an overview of the file organization:

```
├── src/
│   ├── app/            # Application-specific logic
│   ├── components/     # Shared UI components
│   ├── hooks/          # Custom hooks
│   ├── lib/            # Utility libraries
│   ├── server/         # Server-side logic
│   ├── config/         # Configuration files
│   ├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
│   ├── features/       # Modular feature-specific logic
│
├── public/             # Static assets
├── pages/              # Next.js page routes
├── styles/             # Global styles
├── .eslintrc.js        # ESLint configuration
├── tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
└── package.json        # Project dependencies
```

The `boundaries` ESLint plugin enforces module import boundaries:
- **Shared Modules**: Can be accessed by any other module.
- **Feature Modules**: Can only import shared modules or other modules within the same feature.
- **App Modules**: Can import shared and feature modules.
- **Restricted Imports**: Files in `src/tasks/` should not be directly imported.

## Coding Guidelines

To maintain consistency across the project, follow these guidelines:
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety.
- Follow **Next.js best practices**.
- Use **ESLint and Prettier** for code formatting.
- Organize code based on the project’s structure.
- Keep feature modules independent and encapsulated.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
Follow the steps in [Getting Started](#getting-started).

### 2. Create a New Branch
Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
```sh
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```

### 3. Implement Your Changes
Make necessary changes and commit them with a descriptive message:
```sh
git commit -m "Add new feature: detailed description"
```

### 4. Push and Create a Pull Request
Push your changes to your forked repository and create a pull request:
```sh
git push origin feature-branch-name
```
Go to the original repository and open a pull request.
